# Binary Search Tree in Python
# Utilizing the Pycharm IDE

# Main reference, binarytree library documentation: https://readthedocs.org/projects/binarytree/downloads/pdf/latest/

# About Project: This project is called Project: Binary Search Tree for the course MS549.
# I will be implementing a Binary Search Tree (BST) utilizing the Python language for
# Phase 1 of the project implementing Add, Remove, Maximum, Minimum, InOrder, Traverse, and Find
# (with testing of each concept included).
# Then Phase 2 of the project will be to create BSTs and insertion/deletion function with random numbers.  Then I will
# either write API documentation or video the project. 
# Phase 3 will be to establish trend lines of the time durations of insertion/deletion in Phase 2, and compare them
# with Arrays and Linked Lists from previous projects.
# Phase 4 will be to compare/contrast time durations between insert and delete of Linked List and BST
# functionality.
